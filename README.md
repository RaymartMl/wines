Vanilla ecommerce website
======

A group project for my web development class in senior high school. I'm the programmer of the group and also get the materials for the design.
We use a free bootstrap template for this project but the javascript and the cart system was made by me.

Take note that I created this without the knowledge of any templating engine or javascript framework that's why it is unoptimized and every page is hand coded.
